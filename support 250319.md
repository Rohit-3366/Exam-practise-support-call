1 Ensure Wi-Fi is Enabled: Verify that Wi-Fi is turned on on the device and that it's attempting to connect to the correct network.
Restart the Device: A simple reboot can often resolve temporary connectivity issues.
Verify Wi-Fi Network Credentials: Ensure you are attempting to connect to the correct network and have the correct password
 
2. Network Specific Checks:
Forget and Reconnect to the Network:
In Wi-Fi settings, forget the network and then reconnect. This can help reset any saved settings that may be causing the issue.
Check for Network Interference:
If other networks are nearby, try switching to a different Wi-Fi network or ensure you are not too far from the router.
Verify the Router/Access Point:
Ask if other users can connect to the same network. If not, there may be an issue with the router, such as needing a restart or a firmware update. 

3. Device Specific Checks:

Check for IP Address Conflicts:
Ensure that your device is set to obtain an IP address automatically (DHCP) rather than a static IP. If set to static, ensure the IP address doesn't conflict with other devices on the network.
Check Network Configuration (DNS, Proxy, etc.):
Verify that your device's network settings (such as DNS or Proxy) are configured correctly.

4 Update Network Drivers:

Ensure that your device has the latest Wi-Fi drivers installed.
Check Firewall/Security Software:
